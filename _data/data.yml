    summary: |
     I studied at the IT department of the Ionian University. I am 24 years old from
     Limassol, Cyprus. I have developed basic skills in some programming languages that I learn throughout my semester and also by myself in my spare time.
     Another key point that I want to mention is that I am hardworking and try very hard to get the best result as I also happen to be a perfectionist. I am now looking to further develop my skills in my field and particularly in programming because it is an interesting subject that is extremely appealing to me.

        I enjoy University a great deal as there is always a new subject to study and get familiar with which is exciting.
        The subjects vary in term of hours that are needed to be able to understand the concept behind them and to successfully finish the assignments, which makes particular ones somewhat a challenge, but that challenge is always welcome!

        - Unix commands
        - Python
        - Html and Javascript
        - C and C++
