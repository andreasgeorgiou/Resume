        I enjoy University a great deal as there is always a new subject to study and get familiar with which is exciting.
        The subjects vary in term of hours that are needed to be able to understand the concept behind them and to successfully finish the assignments, which makes particular ones somewhat a challenge, but that challenge is always welcome!

        - Unix commands
        - Python
        - Html and Javascript
        - C and C++
