I"#<p>During my studies I learned many things. I learned to solve problems 
and to withstand all the pressures I encountered. Each time in my university assigments I uploaded 
my projects before the deadline. I graduated from Ionian University with a grade of 
<strong>7.44/10.</strong></p>

<p>The University has provided me with the opportunity to develop multiple basic programming skills in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unix Commands</li>
  <li>C &amp; C++</li>
  <li>Java and Javascript</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
</ul>
