I"®<p>I am a graduate of IT Department  at Ionian University of Greece. I am from
Limassol, Cyprus and I am 24 years old. I have developed basic skills in some programming languages that I learn throughout my semester and also by myself in my spare time.
Another key point that I want to mention is that I am hardworking and try very hard to get the best result as I also happen to be a perfectionist. I am now looking to further develop my skills in my field and particularly in cybersecurity because it is an interesting subject that is extremely appealing to me.</p>
